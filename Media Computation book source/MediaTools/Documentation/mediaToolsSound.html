      <b><a name="record"></a>Viewing Sounds While you Record  Them</b>
      <p>To view sounds as you record them, click the Record View button, then the Record button. There are three kinds of views from which you can choose: signal, spectrum, and sonogram.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/mediaToolsSound_recordview.gif" width="412" height="183"></p>
      <p>In the signal view, you&#146;re looking at the sound raw&#151;each increase in air pressure results in an rise in the graph, and each decrease in sound pressure results in a drop in the graph. You can always get back to the signal view from another view by clicking the Signal button.<br>
        </p>
      <p> The spectrum view is a completely different perspective on the sound. The spectrum view shows the different frequencies that are often found in natural sounds. This view is also called the frequency domain.
</p>
      <p>The sonogram view is very much like the spectrum view in that it&#146;s describing the frequency domain, but it presents these frequencies over time.  The sonogram view is great for studying how sounds change over time, e.g., how the sound of a piano key being struck changes as the note fades, or how different instruments di.er in their sounds, or in how different vocal sounds differ.</p>

      <b><a name="index"></a>Finding the Index of a Specific Point in a  Sound File</b>
      <p>If you want to edit or copy just a portion of a digital sound, it can be useful to find the <i>index</i> of a specific point in that sound. To do this in SoundTools, simply open the WaveViewer and find the point in the sound for which you would like to know the index by dragging the red vertical bar back and forth. You can test out where you are by using the &quot;Play Before&quot; and &quot;Play After&quot; buttons. When you find the right place, simply note the index as displayed at the upper left side of the display. (see <a href="#image">Wave Viewer image</a> below)</p>

      <p>Sometimes  it can be useful to find the <i>amplitude</i> of a specific point in a sound. To do this in SoundTools, simply open the WaveViewer and find the point in the sound for which you would like to know the amplitude by dragging the red vertical bar back and forth. You can test out where you are by using the &quot;Play Before&quot; and &quot;Play After&quot; buttons. When you find the right place, simply note the amplitude/value as displayed at the upper left side of the display. (see <a href="#image">Wave Viewer image</a> below)</p>

      <b><a name="fft"></a>Showing FFT (and what FFT is!)</b>
      <p>The technical term for how a spectrum view is generated is called a Fourier transform. A Fourier transform takes the sound from the time domain (rises and falls in the sound over time) into the frequency domain<br>
        (identifying which frequencies are in a sound, and the energy of those frequencies, over time). The specific technique being used in the MediaTools signal view is a Fast Fourier Transform (or FFT), a very common way to do Fourier transforms quickly on a computer so that we can get a real time view of the changing spectra.</p>
      <p>To view the FFT for a specific point in a sound, use the &quot;Show FFT at Cursor&quot; button in the Wave Viewer (see <a href="#image">Wave Viewer image</a> above). <br>
